Question 1: Assume RA and RB both equal 10000 Ω. What are the total resistance and total current in the circuit?

R = 20000 Ω

I = 2.5 * 10^-4 Amp

Question 2: Assume RA = 10000 Ω and RB = 5000 Ω. What are the total resistance and total current in the circuit?

R = 15000 Ω

I = 1/3 * 10^-3

Question 3: Assume RA = 10000 Ω and RB = 5000 Ω. How much voltage is lost through resistor RA? And RB?

VA = 10/3 V

VB = 5/3 V
